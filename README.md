# SFDC Lead Scoring
Simple lead scoring formula for Salesforce

## Setup
- Create a custom formula field in Salesforce
- Paste in the formula in formula.txt
- Replace the fields and corresponding values as necessary to reflect your ideal customers
- Don't forget to change the final number to reflect the total potential sum if each criteria is maxed out in order to output a percentage

## Pro Tips

- While the formula attached only includes Clearbit data, don't forget to include non-clearbit fields like **lead source** to make the formula even more effective.
- If you want to take this one step further, you can use the process builder to perform actions based on your new lead score - you can even route inbound leads to specific reps automatically.
